#Vectors
#Vector R is called as Vectorised Language.
# A collection of elements, and all are of same types.
# It cannot be of mixed type.
# Arrays- n-Dimension COllection of Similar elements in terms of R
#Matrices- Subset of Arrays. 2-d array is called matrix.
# Will usually contain "numeric" value.
